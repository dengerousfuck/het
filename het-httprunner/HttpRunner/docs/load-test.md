## Load Test

With reuse of [`Locust`][Locust], you can run performance test without extra work.

```bash
$ locusts -V
[2017-08-26 23:45:42,246] bogon/INFO/stdout: Locust 0.8a2
[2017-08-26 23:45:42,246] bogon/INFO/stdout:
```

For full usage, you can run `locusts -h` to see help, and you will find that it is the same with `locust -h`.

The only difference is the `-f` argument. If you specify `-f` with a Python locustfile, it will be the same as `locust`, while if you specify `-f` with a `YAML/JSON` testcase file, it will convert to Python locustfile first and then pass to `locust`.

```bash
$ locusts -f examples/first-testcase.yml
[2017-08-18 17:20:43,915] Leos-MacBook-Air.local/INFO/locust.main: Starting web monitor at *:8089
[2017-08-18 17:20:43,918] Leos-MacBook-Air.local/INFO/locust.main: Starting Locust 0.8a2
```

In this case, you can reuse all features of [`Locust`][Locust].

Thatâ€™s not all about it. With the argument `--cpu-cores`, you can even start locust with master and specified number of slaves (default to cpu cores number) at one time, which means you can leverage all cpus of your machine.

```bash
$ locusts -f examples/first-testcase.yml --cpu-cores 4
