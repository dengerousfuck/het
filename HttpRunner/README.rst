Former name: ``ApiTestEngine``.

Design Philosophy
-----------------

Take full reuse of Python's existing powerful libraries: `Requests`_, `unittest`_ and `Locust`_. And achieve the goal of API automation test, production environment monitoring, and API performance test, with a concise and elegant manner.

Key Features
------------

- Inherit all powerful features of `Requests`_, just have fun to handle HTTP in human way.
- Define testcases in YAML or JSON format in concise and elegant manner.
- Record and generate testcases with ``HAR`` support. see `har2case`_.
- Supports ``function``/``variable``/``extract``/``validate`` mechanisms to create full test scenarios.
- With ``debugtalk.py`` plugin, module functions can be auto-discovered in recursive upward directories.
- Testcases can be run in diverse ways, with single testset, multiple testsets, or entire project folder.
- Test report is concise and clear, with detailed log records. See `PyUnitReport`_.
- With reuse of `Locust`_, you can run performance test without extra work.
- CLI command supported, perfect combination with `Jenkins`_.

Documentation
-------------

HttpRunner is rich documented.

- `User documentation`_ helps you to make the most use of HttpRunner
- `Development process blogs`_ will make you fully understand HttpRunner

Next Step
---------

There are still too many awesome features to be implemented. Recent schedules includes:

- [x] Integrate with Charles and Fiddler: convert `HAR`_ (HTTP Archive) format to YAML testcases.
- [ ] Integrate with Swagger: convert exported API definition of `Swagger`_ to YAML testcases.
- [ ] Integrate with PostMan: convert `Postman Collection Format`_ to YAML testcases.
